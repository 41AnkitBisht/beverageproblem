# beverageproblem
For this problem i have used object oriented approach.
1. Creating a temprange class which initialize with High Temperature and Low Temperature(Temp range) <br>
2. Now i have connected the object of this class like nodes in linked list. <br>
3. The insertcontainer function can be used to add new containers. <br>
4. The checkbox function can be used to check temp of box.
5. If the program need to be executed every 2 min the time library in python can be used. <br>
6. For current value of temperature i have used random function in python.
